Relationship: Software design principles & Computational thinking

Question: How to manage complexity?
Solution: Computational thinking

// Cause: bugs could come from a myriad of places...
	A complex system is, by def, very complex > interactions: multiple components

Controlling complexity => essence: computer programming (Brian W. Kernighan)
	Strategies: managing complexity > Computational thinking

Computational thinking > 4 aspects:
	1. Decomposition
	(breaks big/complex problems > smaller & manageable chunks)
		Reductionism (western thought)
		Divide-and-conquer approach (algorithm) > problem solving
	2. Pattern recognition
	(recognize/look for similarities/trends etc.)
	3. Data representation & abstraction
	(focus: what matters)
		(SWEBOK, software design principles)
			Abstraction: 
				Two key mechanisms: parameterization + specification
			SoC (separation of concern)
			Encapsulation & Information hiding 
	Algorithm (design & implementation) etc.
